# function for num and char

# The `r new_iris` data frame has `r sum_na` missing values. In character variables missing values were replaced withthe mean value of that variable and in character variable they were replaced with "virginica". Character value in the new data frame has three distinct values `r names`.

# Problem 2

  - Read in data for each subject

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Read the files

}

               full.names = TRUE)

  - Tidy the result

<!-- end list -->

``` r
trial_tidy =
  trial_df %>%
  pivot_longer(
     -filename,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    filename = str_replace(filename, "./data//", ""),
    filename = str_replace(filename, ".csv", "")
  ) %>%  
  separate(filename, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "\\_")
 
trial_nest = 
  nest(trial_tidy, data = week:value) %>% 
  head()
```

  - Spaghetti plot

<!-- end list -->

``` r
trial_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = subject_id, group = subject_id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~arm)+
  labs(
    title = "Change of values over 8 weeks for each participant"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_ob2305_files/figure-gfm/spaghetti plot-1.png" width="90%" />

The plot above depicts change of values over the 8 weeks of trial for
each participant in control and experimental arms. It can be seen from
the plot that participants in experimental arm had an upward trend of
values, in contrast to participants in the control arm.

# Problem 3

``` r
set.seed(1)

sim_regression = function(beta0 = 2, beta1 = 0) {
  
  data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    y = beta0 + beta1 * x + rnorm(30, 0, sqrt(50))
  )
  
  ls_fit = lm(y ~ x, data = data) %>% 
    broom::tidy()
}
```

Generate 10000 datasets from the model

``` r
set.seed(1)

output_results = rerun(10000, sim_regression()) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  filter(term == "x") %>% 
  select(estimate, p.value) 
```

Hypothesis test

``` r
h_data = 
  output_results %>%
  summarize(
    p.value_acc = sum(p.value <= 0.05),
    p.value_total = n()) 
```

For beta 1:6

``` r
beta1_try = list(1:6)
```
