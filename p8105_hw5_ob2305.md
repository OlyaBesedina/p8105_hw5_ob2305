  - Tidy the result

<!-- end list -->

``` r
trial_tidy =
  trial_df %>%
  pivot_longer(
     -filename,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    filename = str_replace(filename, "./data//", ""),
    filename = str_replace(filename, ".csv", "")
  ) %>%  
  separate(filename, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "\\_")
 
trial_nest = 
  nest(trial_tidy, data = week:value) %>% 
  head()
```

  - Spaghetti plot

<!-- end list -->

``` r
trial_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = subject_id, group = subject_id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~arm)+
  labs(
    title = "Change of values over 8 weeks for each participant"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_ob2305_files/figure-gfm/spaghetti plot-1.png" width="90%" />

The plot above depicts change of values over the 8 weeks of trial for
each participant in control and experimental arms. It can be seen from
the plot that participants in experimental arm had an upward trend of
values, in contrast to participants in the control arm.

# Problem 3

``` r
set.seed(1)

sim_regression = function(beta0 = 2, beta1 = 0) {
  
  data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    y = beta0 + beta1 * x + rnorm(30, 0, sqrt(50))
  )
  
  ls_fit = lm(y ~ x, data = data) %>% 
    broom::tidy()
}
```

Generate 10000 datasets from the model

``` r
set.seed(1)

output_results = rerun(10000, sim_regression()) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(term == "x") %>% 
  select(estimate, p_value) 
```

Simulation for beta 1:6

``` r
sim_results = 
  tibble(
  beta = c(1:6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_list = map(.x = beta, ~rerun(10000, sim_regression(beta1 = .x))),
    output_df = map(output_list, bind_rows)
  ) %>% 
  select(-output_list) %>% 
  unnest(output_df) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(term == "x") %>% 
  select(beta, estimate, p_value) 
```

``` r
sim_results_1 =
  sim_results %>% 
  group_by(beta) %>% 
  count(p_value <0.05) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    p_val_sig = p_value_0_05,
    p_val_count = n) %>% 
  mutate(
     prop = p_val_count / sum(p_val_count)) %>% 
  filter(p_val_sig == "TRUE")
```

    ## Adding missing grouping variables: `beta`

## Plots

Beta1 represends the effect size. Increase in effect size, while keeping
everything constant (alpha and sample size), will cause increase in
power. There is a positive association between effect size and power.
This idea is supported by the plot below.

``` r
sim_results_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beta, y = prop)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "True value",
    y = "Power of the test" 
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_ob2305_files/figure-gfm/ggplot power-1.png" width="90%" />

Make a plot showing the average estimate of β1 on the y axis and the
true value of β1 on the x axis.

``` r
all_estimates = 
  sim_results %>% 
  group_by(beta) %>% 
  mutate(
    ave_estimate = mean(estimate)
    ) %>%
  select(beta, ave_estimate) %>% 
  distinct(beta, ave_estimate)
```

Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average estimate of β̂1
only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the
true value of β1 on the x axis.

``` r
significant_estimates = 
  sim_results %>%
  filter(p_value <= 0.05) %>% 
  group_by(beta) %>%
  mutate(
    ave_sig_estimate = mean(estimate)
    ) %>%
  select(beta, ave_sig_estimate) %>% 
  distinct(beta, ave_sig_estimate) 
```

``` r
merged_estimates = 
  inner_join(all_estimates, significant_estimates, by = "beta") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beta)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ave_estimate, color = "blue")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ave_sig_estimate, color = "yellow")) +
    labs(
    x = "True value of Beta1",
    y = "Average value of estimates" 
  )
```

Blue line on the graph represends the average of 10,000 samples with n =
30 for each beta1. These values correspond to the true values of the
beta1. Yellow line represends the average value of each beta1 for which
the null hypothesis was rejected (H\_0: beta1 = 1:6). As it is seen from
the plot, yellow line approaches blue when effect size increases (given
everything else stays constant).

As effect size increases, so does the power of the test. Yellow line
approaches true value as effect size goes increases, because it is
easier to detect effect size that is large.
